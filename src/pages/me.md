# Pakin Puttanukulchai

## Who am I??

Well, as you can see above, that's my name!

My name is **Pakin Puttanukulchai**, AKA **Bright, Byte, ไบร์ท**. Based on Thailand, Bangkok (technically).
Currently, I'm working at LINE MAN Wongnai as a **software engineer**; mostly focus on the backend development.
You can found out about me professionally in my [resume](/resume.pdf) since I want to use this page to introduce myself in more casual and personal way!


## Interested/Hobby

### Indie musics

I love indie musics (and jazz, and math rock, and MF DOOM). It's a more than a genre for me (and it's dumb to call it genre for me) since it's more like community of people that want to do something unique or personal for them.

It's not like I only listen to non-popular song. It's just that it's harder to find something that could excited me in that market, that's all.

Here's a short list of the kind of musics that I listen (not all, of course):

- **Plastic Plastic**: Easy listening, playful music and lyric, but they aren't shy to do something thoughtful. It's hard to explain why I love them so much but I really am.
- **Lamp**: Sweet, soothing yet hypnotic sound. Either a late night before sleep type or a music that I would listen to while sipping some tea.
- **Masayoshi Takanaka**: Energetic, lively, fresh, joyful summer fusion jazz. That's the best way to describe his work.
- **_less**: A fresh and exciting take on what "pop music" could be, their music is complex in layer yet so mesmerized and easy to listen to, super underrated and I'm all for them.
- **MF DOOM**: A legendary and influencial rapper, the mind-bending rhymth combine with jazzy sample really make me love him. I'm so regret that I know about him so late.
- **Sunset Rollercoaster**: A Teipei-based band with sweetest melody I have ever listen to.
- **Safeplanet**: I mean, do I really have to tell you? Bold and unique sound with crazy solo, while still expand their boundary with new idea. Really deserved to be the representation of Thai indie industry.
- **Jakob**: Mellow, soft, sweet sound and vocal, pure joy.
- **Solitude is Bliss**: Raw, emotional, thoughtful yet so enjoyable to listen. It's so obvious while they could form a cult like fans with their  incredible songs.
- **mitsume**: Calm, easy listening, there's a lot of J-Indie like this so I recommend you to explore more!
- **H 3 F**: Jazyy & funky sound with incredible performance. It's such a blessing for us Thai to have a band like this that embrace their own take of jazz to such a high degree.

### Audiophiles

Well, I just want a gear to make me enjoy the music, and normal stuff just doesn't cut it.

I'm still rocking on wired IEM every single day (if I have to go outside) since I couldn't find wireless one that's actually good (Airpod Pro 3 is still not that good for me, but I might have to test it again)

Right now (2025) I use **Hifiman Arya Stealth** with **Topping DX 3 pro+** on my desk, and **Kiwi Ears KE4** with apple dongles outside, and just macbook speaker on my bed.

### Keyboards

Well, I don't really follow the community as much as I do in 2020, the major factor is probably the fact that I bought **Neo Ergo** and it's just really hard to justify buying something more expensive than it, it's just too good for its price point.

I MIGHT dive into ergonomic keyboard again if I feel like it, but I'm happy with just my weird binding on macbook keyboard right now so no promise.


## Tech/Tools that I'm interested with right now

Currently, as of 2025 (or later if I forget to change this page), I have some interested mainly things related to programming (in it purest form) in general.


### Go

Go is probably my blind pick right now if I want something quick and not just some small script. It's a comfy language to work with, but after years of using and loving it, I start to yearn for something more. I'm functional programming guy so it's still itchy in brain that I can't to much in Go. Sometimes I just want my program to be stupidy lean that Go cannot give (even if it's not practical). Let's just say that I almost perfect the language and I clearly see the limitation of it, and I accept on what it is.

### Rust

Rust seems like a language that I would yearned for, inspired by functional language, abstract data type, extendable via macros, very lean with no GC. However, it's really hard language to feel confident in, I study about it for years now and I'm still not confident in it, like, I know to the point of RefCell, Pin/Unpin, Send/Sync, but I still feel like I'm missing something to feel confident to say I know Rust.

Even if i'm saying that, the process of learning its quirk really help me understand the underlined abstraction that you wouldn't (or not have to) care about it. I still remember the time that I learn about static dispatch vs dynamic dispatch from `Box<dyn T>`, but it's also the reason why I couldn't say myself that I really know the language.

### Gleam

Gleam is another language that make me fall in love with it just from the syntax itself. The only problem I have with it is that I feel thorned to use these kind of language that is obviously less efficient than Go (I feel like i'm obsessed with native executable binary right now, sorry Gleam), but it's definitely have a special place in my heart.

### Functional Programming

For me, it's not a paradigm of programming, it's more like a way to convey the thought to something more mathematic. Maybe because I'm interested in math quite a bit, but the abstractoin that FP give just make my brain feel good to use it. Some might say that it's a dumb idea to write a clever code, but it's partially true for me. We might mistaken the elegance with cleverness but it's entirely different thing and we have to understand that. 

### Colemak-DH

An alternative keyboard layout that I use for a few years now. You could read my full impression in my blog, but for short, it's 100% worth it for me. Maybe it's combined with more streamlined shortcut that I use, but it really make me feel confident and less strained while typing.

### Helix

If I don't have to use any AI functionality, this is it. The only one editor I need in my entire life, so please the love of god, just add plugins system so I could add some AI slop into my code.

The reason I choose it over Neovim to this day because I still cannot set up Lazyvim in the way I like while I could do it in a day with Helix, so why bother at this point.

Technically, I can just use CLI tools like claude-code, but the problem for me is that it's harder to read the diff that CLI tools created than the clear diff in cursor, combining with the fact that I got free Cursor in my work, I just decide to open both Helix and Cursor at the same times.

### Macbook

TBH, only reason that I still stick with Macbook is because of the hardware (and the fact that my company give me a free Macbook for work). If I could choose, I probably just want Macbook with linux.
