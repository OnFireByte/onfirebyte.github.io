# Astro + Svelte + Tailwind + Beige + Monospace font + Me

Do you ever have an impulse like "Damn, I should rebuild my again this time"? Yeah, that's me.

Old stack:

-   Vite? pain af if you gonna do MD page stuff.
-   React? slow shit.
-   Tailwind? Well, it's always good doe.
-   Colorful accent? nah, this is not bleeding edge js lib.
-   Dark mode? Fuck that, not everything shoud be in the dark.
-   Jetbrains Mono? well, it's actually good.

New stack:

-   Astro - SSG without pain stuff + great MD support
-   Svelte - not new cool kid in the club anymore, but damn, it's so fun to write in Svelte.
-   Tailwind - it's good, that's it
-   Beige - earth tone boy ðŸ˜Ž
